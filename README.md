# th_armor
A basic remake of esx_armour that uses progress bars and skill bar. For the th_armor to work you need np-taskbar and for the skillbar u need reload-skillbar.

I'm not sure about that because I didn't test that but the sql file will work with disc-iventory weight so it wont properly with esx_inventoryhud
